# ðŸ§  Multi-Resolution Region Merging (MRRM)

MRRM is a post-processing framework designed to improve the geometric consistency of building segmentation results generated by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), particularly in rural areas where fragmentation, pixelation, and over-segmentation are common.

This notebook integrates dual-resolution SAM outputs (10 cm and 25 cm GSD) to merge fragmented segments while preserving shape fidelity and spatial accuracy.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Merges SAM-based building polygons using multi-resolution references
- Reduces fragmentation and salt-and-pepper artifacts
- Preserves geometric detail using Douglas-Peucker simplification
- Suitable for rural base map production workflows

## ðŸš€ How to Run (Google Colab)

1. Open the notebook in Colab:  
   [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/MRRM/blob/main/MRRM.ipynb)

2. Upload your segmentation shapefiles at 10 cm and 25 cm resolution

3. Configure parameters:
   ```python
   BUFFER_SIZE = 0.5  # 50 cm
   SIMPLIFY_TOLERANCE = 0.2  # 20 cm (2 pixels at 10 cm GSD)
